## Inspiration
Frequent international travelers knows the struggle to get a travel visa for their destination: finding the correct visa, finding out where to apply, how to apply and what to answer to get approved is an unnecessary hassle.

## What it does
Integrating the SimpleVisa API into the current AirBerlin flow allows any traveler that book a flight ticket to apply for an electronic visa at the same time, if required.

## How I built it
I reproduced the current AirBerlin App flow and integrated an on-demand electronic travel visa API in the process.

## Challenges I ran into
The airline API was giving me errors when I tried to create a booking, so I simulated the last part of the booking process.

## What I learned
While I spoke to the AirBerlin team, I learned that the United States was a big market for the airline, so I focused the demo app on this specific destination country.

## What's next for AirBerlin-SimpleVisa-BusinessChallenge
Integrating the two APIs together was not too complicated, so I can see the concept extended to other destinations countries: wherever you travel to a destination country that requires an electronic visa, you can do it right from the AirBerlin app.
